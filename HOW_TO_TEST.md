# How To Test Your Website

**Quick Start Guide for Testing Security Improvements**

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Check Your Environment Setup

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /home/user/barbershop-website

# 2. Check if .env file exists
ls -la .env

# If .env doesn't exist, create it:
cp .env.example .env
```

### Step 2: Configure Firebase (Required)

Open `.env` file and add your Firebase credentials:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_actual_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

**Where to get these?**
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project (or create one)
3. Click ‚öôÔ∏è Settings ‚Üí Project Settings
4. Scroll down to "Your apps" ‚Üí Web app
5. Copy all the values

### Step 3: Add Owner Contact (Optional but Recommended)

In your `.env` file:

```env
# Your WhatsApp number (without + sign)
VITE_OWNER_WHATSAPP=972501234567

# Your phone number
VITE_OWNER_PHONE=972501234567
```

### Step 4: Start the Development Server

```bash
# Install dependencies if you haven't already
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ Environment variables validated successfully

  VITE v5.1.0  ready in 500 ms

  ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ‚ûú  Network: use --host to expose
```

### Step 5: Open in Browser

Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:5173/**

## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist

### 1. Test Environment Validation ‚úÖ

**What to test:** App should validate environment variables on startup

**How to test:**
```bash
# Try starting with missing Firebase config
# Temporarily rename .env
mv .env .env.backup

# Start the app
npm run dev

# You should see a red error screen with:
# "‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration Error"
# "The application is not properly configured"

# Restore .env
mv .env.backup .env
npm run dev
```

**Expected:** Red error screen when env vars missing ‚úÖ

**What to test:** New password requirements and strength indicator

**How to test:**
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/
2. Click "Sign Up" or login button
3. Click "Don't have an account? Sign up"
4. Enter a name and email
5. Start typing a password

**Test these passwords:**
- `12345678` - Should show "Weak" (no uppercase/special)
- `Password` - Should show "Weak" (no number/special)
- `Password123` - Should show "Medium" (no special char)
- `Password123!` - Should show "Strong" ‚úÖ

**Expected:**
- Real-time strength indicator appears

### 3. Test XSS Protection ‚úÖ

**What to test:** Booking notifications don't allow script injection

**How to test:**
1. Create a test booking with malicious input:
   - Name: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
   - Phone: `<img src=x onerror="alert('XSS')">`
2. Submit the booking
3. Check if any alerts pop up

**Expected:**
- NO alerts should appear
- Text is displayed as plain text (not executed)
- React automatically escapes the input ‚úÖ

---

### 4. Test Secure Booking IDs ‚úÖ

**What to test:** Booking IDs are now random UUIDs

**How to test:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Create a few test bookings
4. Check the console logs

**Expected:**
- Booking IDs look like: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`
- NOT like: `booking-1729612800000-abc123` ‚úÖ

### 5. Test Protected Routes (If Implemented) ‚úÖ

**What to test:** Admin pages require authentication

**How to test:**
1. Make sure you're logged OUT
2. Try to access admin page (if you have one set up)
3. You should see "Authentication Required" screen

**Then:**
1. Log in with a regular user account
2. Try to access admin page
3. You should see "Access Denied" (not admin)

**Expected:**
- Unauthenticated users redirected
- Non-admin users see "Access Denied" ‚úÖ

---

### 6. Test Input Validation (When Integrated) ‚úÖ

**What to test:** Booking form validates inputs

**Test these invalid inputs:**
- Phone: `123` (too short)
- Phone: `abcd` (not a number)
- Email: `notanemail` (invalid format)
- Name: `@#$%` (invalid characters)

**Expected:**
- Clear error messages
- Form won't submit with invalid data ‚úÖ

---

### 7. Test No Credentials in Console/Storage ‚úÖ

**What to test:** No sensitive data exposed

**How to test:**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application ‚Üí Local Storage
3. Check all stored data

**Expected:**
- NO passwords or tokens in localStorage
- NO Twilio credentials visible
- Only booking data and user preferences ‚úÖ

---

### 8. Test PII Redaction in Logs ‚úÖ

**What to test:** Logger redacts sensitive information

**How to test:**
1. Open DevTools Console (F12)
2. Look at any logs that mention customer data
3. Check if phone numbers/emails are redacted

**Expected:**
- Phone numbers show as `[PHONE_REDACTED]`
- Emails show as `[EMAIL_REDACTED]`
- Passwords never logged ‚úÖ
