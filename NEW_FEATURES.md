## üöÄ What You Need to Do Next

### CRITICAL: Set Up Firebase

**You MUST complete Firebase setup for these features to work!**

Follow the guide: `FIREBASE_SETUP.md`

**Quick Steps:**
1. Create Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Enable Email/Password and Google authentication
3. Create Firestore database
4. Copy your Firebase credentials
5. Create `.env` file with your credentials
6. Restart your dev server

**Without Firebase setup, the new features won't work!**

## üìù Still To Do (From Your Original Request)

### ‚è≥ Pending Features:

#### 8. Appointment Reminders (SMS/Email 24h before)
- **Status**: Not implemented yet
- **Recommendation**: Use Firebase Cloud Functions or Twilio
- **Complexity**: Requires scheduled tasks/cron jobs

#### 9. Confirmation Messages for Bookings
- **Status**: Partially implemented (browser alerts)
- **Recommendation**: Add proper notification system with toast messages
- **Can improve**: Better UI feedback instead of `alert()`

#### 10. Cancellation/Rescheduling Options
- **Status**: Not implemented yet
- **Recommendation**: Add "Cancel" and "Reschedule" buttons in booking history
- **Complexity**: Medium - need to update Firestore and notify admin

#### 11. Calendar Auto-Fill for Appointments
- **Status**: Not implemented yet
- **Explanation**: Generate .ics files for customers to add to their calendar
- **Recommendation**: Use `ics` npm package
- **Complexity**: Easy to add
