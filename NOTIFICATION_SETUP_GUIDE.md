# SHOKHA Barbershop - Notification Setup Guide

## Quick Start

The notification system is already integrated into your app. Here's how to configure it:

## 1. WhatsApp Notifications (Recommended - Free & Easy)

### Owner WhatsApp Setup:
1. Open `src/services/notificationService.ts`
2. Find this line:
   ```typescript
   ownerWhatsapp: '972501234567', // Replace with your number
   ```
3. Replace with your actual WhatsApp number (include country code)
   - Israel: 972 + your number (without the 0)
   - Example: If your number is 050-123-4567, use: 972501234567

### How It Works:
- When a customer books, a WhatsApp Web link opens
- The message is pre-filled with all booking details
- Just click "Send" to receive it on your phone
- No API key needed - uses WhatsApp Web

## 2. Email Notifications (Optional)

If you want email notifications too:

### Step 1: Create EmailJS Account
1. Go to https://www.emailjs.com/
2. Sign up for free account
3. Create an email service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
4. Create an email template
5. Get your credentials

### Step 2: Update Configuration
1. Open `src/services/notificationService.ts`

     templateId: 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID',
     publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'
   }
   ```

## 3. Owner Dashboard Access

### Login URL:
- Local: http://localhost:5173/admin
- Production: https://your-domain.com/admin

### Default Password:
