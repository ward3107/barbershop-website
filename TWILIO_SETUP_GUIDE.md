## 🔧 Step-by-Step Setup (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Twilio Account

1. Go to: https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio
2. Click **"Sign up and start building"**
3. Fill in your details:
   - Email: your email
   - Password: create strong password
4. Verify your email
5. Verify your phone number (they'll send you a code)

### Step 2: Get Free Trial Credits

- Twilio gives you **$15 FREE credit** to start
- This is enough for **3,000 WhatsApp messages**!
- Perfect for testing and first few months

### Step 3: Set Up WhatsApp Sandbox (For Testing)

1. In Twilio Console, go to: **Messaging** → **Try it out** → **Send a WhatsApp message**
2. You'll see a screen with:
   - A WhatsApp number (like: **+1 415 523 8886**)
   - A join code (like: **"join XXXXX"**)

3. **On your phone:**
   - Open WhatsApp
   - Send a message to: **+1 415 523 8886**
   - Type: **"join [your-code]"** (the code they show you)
   - You'll get a confirmation message

4. **Save these details** (you'll need them):
   ```
   Twilio WhatsApp Number: +1 415 523 8886
   Join Code: join XXXXX
   ```

### Step 4: Get Your API Credentials

1. In Twilio Console, go to **Dashboard**
2. Find the **"Account Info"** section
3. Copy these 2 values:
   - **Account SID** (starts with "AC...")
   - **Auth Token** (click the eye icon to reveal it)

**IMPORTANT**: Keep these SECRET! Don't share with anyone.

### Step 5: Configure Your Website

1. Open your website in browser
2. Open browser console (Press F12)
3. Paste this code (replace with YOUR values):

```javascript
// Get these from Twilio Dashboard
const accountSid = 'ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';  // Your Account SID
const authToken = 'your_auth_token_here';                // Your Auth Token
const whatsappNumber = 'whatsapp:+14155238886';          // Twilio WhatsApp number

// Save to your website
localStorage.setItem('twilio_config', JSON.stringify({
  accountSid: accountSid,
  authToken: authToken,
  whatsappNumber: whatsappNumber
}));

console.log('✅ Twilio configured successfully!');
```

4. Press Enter
5. Refresh the page

### Step 6: Test It!

1. Go to your website: http://localhost:5173
2. Book an appointment (use your own phone number)
3. Check your WhatsApp - you should get a message!

## 🎯 For Production (After Testing):

### Option A: Keep Using Sandbox (FREE but limited)
- Free forever
- Only works for numbers that join your sandbox
- Good if you test each customer number first

### Option B: Activate WhatsApp Business API ($$$)
- Costs money after trial credits
- Works for ANY phone number
- Professional for real business

**To activate production:**
1. Twilio Console → **Messaging** → **WhatsApp senders**
2. Click **"Request to enable my Twilio numbers for WhatsApp"**
3. Fill in business details
4. Wait 1-3 days for approval
5. Add payment method (credit card)

---

## 🔒 Security Notes:

### Keep Your Credentials Secret!
Never share:
- Account SID
- Auth Token

### Better Security (Optional):
Instead of storing in localStorage, create a backend API:
1. Create Node.js server
2. Store credentials in .env file
3. Frontend calls your API → API calls Twilio

## 📞 WhatsApp Message Templates:

Your automatic messages will look like this:

### When customer books (to YOU):
```
🔔 حجز جديد - New Booking

👤 العميل: Ahmed Ali
📱 الهاتف: 05XXXXXXXX
✂️ الخدمة: Haircut + Beard
📅 التاريخ: 19/10/2025
⏰ الوقت: 2:00 PM

SHOKHA BARBERSHOP
```

### When you approve (to CUSTOMER):
```
✅ موعدك مؤكد - Appointment Confirmed

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

### "Failed to send WhatsApp"
- Check your Twilio Account SID and Auth Token
- Make sure you have credits in your account
- Verify customer phone number is in sandbox (for testing)

### "Number not in sandbox"
- Customer needs to send "join [code]" first
- Or upgrade to production WhatsApp API

### "Invalid phone number"
- Phone numbers must be in format: +972XXXXXXXXX
- The code automatically formats Israeli numbers (05XXXXXXXX → +972XXXXXXXXX)

---

## 💡 Tips:

1. **Start with sandbox** - Test everything for FREE
2. **Monitor costs** - Check Twilio dashboard regularly
3. **Add alerts** - Twilio can email you when credits run low
4. **Backup plan** - Keep browser notifications as backup

---

## 📊 Cost Calculator:

- 20 bookings/month = $0.20
